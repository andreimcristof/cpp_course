# _
pet project for the lolz. learning c++ to understand differences to c#

##### gotchas

- declaration is in header files. Implementation is in cpp files. 
- classes cannot be redeclared in the implementation cpp, must access members by namespace to implement them

##### compilation

g++ -o /tmp/output.sh *.cpp -std=c++14
